			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I am a sophomore CS major with a math minor at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and I love many forms of problem solving. My favorite types of problems are those in computer science, math, and chess. In my free time, I do a mix of studying chess, video games, walking outside, and time permitting, playing at chess tournaments.</p>
